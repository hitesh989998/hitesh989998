# Hi, I'm Hitesh Lalwani

I'm a Full Stack Developer with expertise in building modern, scalable web applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and a knack for solving complex problems. I work across the entire development lifecycle, from crafting sleek UIs to designing rock-solid backends, ensuring everything runs like clockwork.
