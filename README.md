# Hi, I'm Hitesh Lalwani

I’m a Full Stack Developer who loves building modern and scalable web apps. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and handle everything—from designing smooth, user-friendly UIs with React to setting up fast and secure backends with Node.js and Express.js; making sure everything runs like clockwork.
